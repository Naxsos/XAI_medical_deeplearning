"""
To apply the fix to your existing notebook:

1. Run the following code at the beginning of your notebook:

```python
# Load improved loss function
%run fixes/improved_loss.py
```

2. Then, when you're about to train the model, replace:

```python
criterion = SelfCorrectiveAttentionLoss(lambda_consistency=0, lambda_sparsity=0.001)
```

with:

```python
criterion = ImprovedSelfCorrectiveAttentionLoss(lambda_consistency=0.1, lambda_sparsity=0.1)
```

That's it! This change should make your sparsity loss converge properly.
"""

# Explanation of why the original loss didn't converge:
"""
The original sparsity loss had these issues:

1. Entropy-based sparsity loss (attn_flat * torch.log(attn_flat)) doesn't work well
   for attention maps that are already somewhat activated in specific regions.
   
2. The division by 1000 made the loss contribution too small (0.001 * (value/1000))
   which meant the gradient signal was too weak to affect the model's behavior.
   
3. The lambda_sparsity value was set too low (0.001) relative to the classification
   loss, making its contribution to the total loss negligible.

The improved loss fixes these issues by:

1. Using L1 regularization which directly encourages true sparsity by 
   penalizing any non-zero attention values
   
2. Removing the artificial division by 1000
   
3. Increasing the weight to 0.1 so the sparsity loss can meaningfully
   contribute to model optimization

Additionally, the improved version includes a Gini coefficient calculation
as an alternative sparsity measure if you want to try that instead of L1.
